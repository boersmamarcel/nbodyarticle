C++ n-body simulator and visualiser
======================================

Dependencies
------------
The program makes use of OpenGL and SDL2. The OpenGL includes and the OpenGL library compiler flag in the Makefile are Mac OS X specific, though trivial to change for e.g. Linux.

To install SDL2 you can use `brew install sdl2` when using Homebrew on Mac OS X.

Usage
-----
To compile use `make`. To run the program use `./sim` on the command line.
