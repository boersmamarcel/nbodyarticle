\section{Introduction (phenomena)}
A world famous problem is the two body problem, most commonly known as the sun - earth problem.

\section{Literature Study}
background etc
\subsection{Newton's law}
\begin{equation}
 F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}
\end{equation}
With G as a gravitational constant and F as the force in Newton and $m_1,m_2$ the mass of the two systems in kg and $r$ is the distance between the center of the two bodies (see figure xx). 
Keplers problem? 
\subsection{Kepler}
Kepler problem, special case the Kepler orbit problem



\section{Methodology}
Assume that we have an initial velocity vector $\overrightarrow{v_t}$ for the body t with speed in both x and y direction.
\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{v_t} = \begin{bmatrix}
								x_t \\
								y_t
							\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
For example we have a two body system with $p,c$ with an initial velocity vector, respectively, then
\begin{equation}
	v_p=\begin{bmatrix} v_x^p \\ v_y^p \end{bmatrix}, v_c=\begin{bmatrix} v_x^c \\ v_y^c \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
We assume that the whole system has a constant velocity, in our case we assume zero velocity, hence the next equation must be equal to zero
\begin{equation}
	V = \frac{P}{M}	
\end{equation}
with $P$ as the total momentum and $M$ as the total mass of the system. We know that the total momentum is the sum of all forces acted up on and the mass is a constant. Therefore, our zero velocity implies that the total momentum must be equal to zero. Or more formally
\begin{equation}
	P = m_p\overrightarrow{v_p} + m_c\overrightarrow{v_c} = 0.
\end{equation}
As illustrated in figure~\ref{XXXX}(simple two body system with vectors drawn) we can see that each body has several forces acted upon. Our objective is the determine the path of body $p,c$ and as you can see we have a force vector $F_x$ pulling the body $X$ to the center and also our velocity vector $v_x$. The product of those vectors gives us the directional vector of our body $X$. Due to the fact that the two bodies are the only objects in the system acting on eachother we can determine the radius and period of our movement around a (virtual) center of mass. We know for a fact that the two bodies must be the opposites of eachother such that the total momentum is equal to zero. The center of mass can be calculated in reference of one of our bodies. 
\begin{equation}
	(m_p + m_c)\overrightarrow{r_{m}} = m_p\overrightarrow{r_p} + m_c\overrightarrow{r_c} 
\end{equation}
With $r_m$ being the vector to the center of mass, the we can rewrite this to calculate $r_m$
\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{r_m} = \frac{m_p\overrightarrow{r_p} + m_c\overrightarrow{r_c}}{(m_p + m_c)}
\end{equation}
and we will calculate the $\overrightarrow{r_m}$ with as reference point our body $C$, then the $\overrightarrow{r_c}=0$ because the distance between our body $C$ and $C$ is zero, and the $\overrightarrow{r_p}=R$ with $R$ as the total distance between the two bodies. Then $\overrightarrow{r_m}$ becomes
\begin{equation}
	\overrightarrow{r_m} = \frac{m_p}{M}\overrightarrow{R}
\end{equation}
